## Personal Summary

I am a platform engineer at Hostworks, where I have had the opportunity to support some of Australia's biggest household brands. Most recently, I've been supporting and maintaining the platforms that Hostworks use to deliver amazing service. It's a broad role that gave me exposure to cutting edge technologies like Hadoop, Bosun and Openstack, while still keeping on top of everyday technologies.

I'm the kind of person that just wants to make life easy for the team. One of my biggest accomplishments was the re-development of an automated patching system to manage operating systems and security updates of customer environments using the HP Server Automation toolset. I've completed many side projects, such as interfacing with external services through RESTful API's to create domain and certificate tools for front-line staff. I have also rewritten Hostworks MySQL backup scripts and processes, integrating them with Hostworks management portals.
I love creating scripts and tools to automate or simplify management tasks, and enjoy the challenges that this work provides.

Prior to this I worked as a front-line support engineer, resolving issues with customer environments, helping customers to get what they need out of their managed IT environment. Incident resolution, environment builds, expansions, maintenance, configuration, and decommissioning were all in a days work!

## Employment Summary

### Apr 2016 - Mar 2017: Platform Engineer, Hostworks

As a platform engineer, I maintain the platforms and services that customer environments require to function. Uptime for these platforms and services was critical, as issues with the platforms and services would result in downtime for our customers. Platforms and services included Openstack private cloud, VMware vSphere environments, shared mail relays, proxies, NTP services, and centralised logging. In addition to this, I have been involved in the roll out and maintenance of an IBM monitoring and patching toolset.

I am also part of a larger team of Linux/Unix specialists across the business, and we created a Hostworks standard that ensured common configuration techniques across all environments. These standards ensured that when a system or service was designed and built, it worked first time, every time.

Most recently I designed and built a next generation monitoring platform using Hadoop (Cloudera CDH), Bosun, Redis, and Grafana. While the platform provided monitoring functionality to customers and front-line staff, it also opened up options for security monitoring, capacity planning, incident tracking, trending and analysis functions.

### Jul 2015 - Apr 2017: L3 Systems Administrator (Linux/Unix), Hostworks

As a level 3 systems administrator, I was responsible for the ongoing maintenance/improvement and change management of customer environments. I was an escalation point for front-line resources, providing training, technical support and resolving incidents. I was also responsible for proactively maintaining customer environments, identifying and resolving problems, capacity planning and assisting the customer with change planning and management. I was also on an oncall roster and could be counted on to assist at any time. In addition to all of this, I was also responsible for building and commissioning customer environments - either as new environments, or migrating/refreshing existing environments.

In this role I was responsible for the redevelopment of an automated patching system using the HP Server Automation toolset. The system managed scheduling, patching and reporting of linux hosts throughout all Hostworks's environments, and resulted in a reduced workload for front-line support teams, who were then able to focus on adding value to our customer relationships.

In addition to the patching system, I developed Domain and SSL Certificate management portals. These portals retrieved relevant data from our domain and certificate registrar API's and automatically notified customers of upcoming expiry dates via the Hostworks job tracking system API. This also reduced the workload of our front-line support team, enabling them to improve our customer relationships.

### Jun 2009 - Jul 2015: L2 Systems Administrator (Linux/Unix), Hostworks

As a level 2 systems administrator, I was a member of the front-line support team, dealing directly with customers, performing configuration tasks and resolving incidents. I performed many daily maintenance tasks - patching, backup tape management, user management, service configuration/reconfiguration, and general system maintenance tasks. I quickly extended my systems administration skills and became proficient with Linux (Redhat) and Unix (Solaris) systems, which allowed me to specialise.

### 2006 - 2009: Desktop Support/Junior Systems Administrator, Capricorn Society Ltd

I started my time at Capricorn as a desktop support person, providing desktop support to an office of approximately 50 people. I supported staff in any way that it was required - user management, login issues, printing problems, accessing file shares, formatting Word documents or PowerPoint presentations, as well as performing system rebuilds and data transfer from old systems (laptops/desktops) to new systems. Capricorn also created a Junior systems administrator role for me, which started me on the path that I am on today. As a systems administrator, I performed system maintenance, managed backup tapes, and assisted with hardware upgrades, and was an escalation point for the Desktop support team.

### 2004 - 2006 : Support/Advanced Support/Fault Management/Provisioning, EFTel

As a support person at EFTel (a Perth based ISP) I was responsible for resolving issues with customer's internet connection and services. This involved Dialup and ADSL connections, and also included things like as email client/browser configuration and troubleshooting. As a member of the provisioning and fault management team, I was responsible for liaising with upstream providers (Telstra) to log and track faults, and provision telephony services.
