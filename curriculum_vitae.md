## Personal Summary

I am an infrastructure architect for CoreLogic, the largest provider of property information, analytics and property-related risk management services in Australia and New Zealand. 

I'm passionate about transformational change, and the implementation of observability solutions drive improved business outcomes. 

## Employment Summary

### CoreLogic International (AU,NZ,UK)
__Principal, Infrastructure Architect__  
__Jan 2019 - Present__

As the principal infrastructure architect, I have the opportunity to influence and drive positive change across the CoreLogic business. This position requires me to think strategically about products and tooling we are using (or intending to use) and make decisions that align with the business's current (and long term) targets and goals.

This role is unique in that I perform typical architectural activies, such as reviewing and approving infrastructure architectural patterns before implementation, but the business also allows me to take a hands on role in productionisation of new technologies and tooling. In order to support this, I collaborate across all levels of the business.

In this role I have been able to be a part of a number of key initiatives in the business, such as the establishment of an SRE function, transition to data driven operational intelligence, and migration between public cloud providers. As a part of the cloud provider migration I have been instrumental in the creation of a federated operating model, driving integration between the US,AU, and UK CoreLogic businesses.

Recently another key area that I have had the opportunity to contribute to is the creation of an observability strategy for the Australian business. This work involved an assesment of the current tooling, indentification of requirements. This work is still in progress.

__Professional, Development Operations__  
__Jan 2018 - Dec 2018__

As a Development Operations engineer, I am responsible for the cloud based infrastructre in use at CoreLogic International. This includes environment provisioning and maintenance, cloud provider cost optimization, best practice implementation and technology stack improvements. 

A significant portion of this role included liasing with application teams to create the best possible environment with the tools and products available. In some cases this involved identifying areas that could make the application more elastic or fault tolerant, while in other cases I haved the opportunity to design an entire environment: architecting for security, reliability, efficiency, and cost.

__Professional, Systems Administration__  
__Mar 2017 - Dec 2017__

As a Systems Administrator I was a member of the team responsbile for all of the linux based on premise infrastructure. This included patching, supporting application releases, OS upgrades, configuration managment and best practice implementation. In addition to this, we the first point of contact for application teams experiencing problems with their applications. Often this involved identifying resource constraints (cpu/memory/disk) or diagnosing connectivty between other application environments. 

In addition to supporting existing release processes, I also had the opportunity to refactor the release process, moving from a script based release process to an automation platform (Jenkins & Ansible). This allowed less technical members of the ICT team to manage the release process with just a few clicks.

One of the more important projects I was able to work on was the migration of a critical API to an AWS environment. The API platform was migrated from on premise server environment to an AWS autoscaling environment. The release process was implemented using a gitlab pipeline that supported a number of release management process that the business required (change approval, separation of duty etc). The process that we create for this API has now also been applied to many of the other applications required by the business. 

###  Hostworks
__Platform Engineer__  
__Apr 2016 - Mar 2017__

As a platform engineer, I maintained the platforms and services that customer environments require to function. Uptime for these platforms and services was critical, as issues with the platforms and services would result in downtime for customers. Platforms and services included Openstack private cloud, VMware vSphere environments, shared mail relays, proxies, NTP services, and centralised logging. In addition to this, I was involved in the roll out and maintenance of an IBM monitoring and patching toolset.

I was also part of a larger team of Linux/Unix specialists across the business. Together we created a Hostworks standard that ensured common configuration techniques across all environments. These standards ensured that when a system or service was designed and built, it worked first time, every time.

One of the most enjoyable projects i was able to work on was the design and build of a next generation monitoring platform using Hadoop ([Cloudera CDH](https://www.cloudera.com/products/open-source/apache-hadoop/key-cdh-components.html)), [Bosun](https://bosun.org/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). While the platform provided monitoring functionality to customers and front-line staff, it also opened up options for security monitoring, capacity planning, incident tracking, trending and analysis functions.

__Level 3 Systems Administrator (Linux/Unix)__  
__Jul 2015 - Apr 2017__

As a level 3 systems administrator, I was responsible for the ongoing maintenance/improvement and change management of customer environments. I was an escalation point for front-line resources, providing training, technical support and resolving incidents. I was also responsible for proactively maintaining customer environments, identifying and resolving problems, capacity planning and assisting the customer with change planning and management. I was also on an oncall roster and could be counted on to assist at any time. In addition to all of this, I was also responsible for building and commissioning customer environments - either as new environments, or migrating/refreshing existing environments.

In this role I was responsible for the redevelopment of an automated patching system using the HP Server Automation toolset. The system managed scheduling, patching and reporting of linux hosts throughout all Hostworks's environments, and resulted in a reduced workload for front-line support teams, who were then able to focus on adding value to our customer relationships.

In addition to the patching system, I developed Domain and SSL Certificate management portals. These portals retrieved relevant data from our domain and certificate registrar API's and automatically notified customers of upcoming expiry dates via the Hostworks job tracking system API. This reduced the workload of our front-line support team, enabling them to improve our customer relationships.

__Level 2 Systems Administrator (Linux/Unix)__  
__Jun 2009 - Jul 2015__

As a level 2 systems administrator, I was a member of the front-line support team, dealing directly with customers, performing configuration tasks and resolving incidents. I performed many daily maintenance tasks - patching, backup tape management, user management, service configuration/reconfiguration, and general system maintenance tasks. I quickly extended my systems administration skills and became proficient with Linux (Redhat) and Unix (Solaris) systems, which allowed me to specialise.

### Capricorn Society Ltd
__Desktop Support/Junior Systems Administrator__  
__2006 - 2009__

I started my time at Capricorn as a desktop support person, providing desktop support to an office of approximately 50 people. I supported staff in any way that it was required - user management, login issues, printing problems, accessing file shares, formatting Word documents or PowerPoint presentations, as well as performing system rebuilds and data transfer from old systems (laptops/desktops) to new systems. Capricorn also created a Junior systems administrator role for me, which started me on the path that I am on today. As a systems administrator, I performed system maintenance, managed backup tapes, and assisted with hardware upgrades, and was an escalation point for the Desktop support team.


### EFTel
__Support, Advanced Support, Fault Management & Provisioning__  
__2004 - 2006__

As a support person at EFTel (a Perth based ISP) I was responsible for resolving issues with customer's internet connection and services. This involved Dialup and ADSL connections, and also included things like as email client/browser configuration and troubleshooting. As a member of the provisioning and fault management team, I was responsible for liaising with upstream providers (Telstra) to log and track faults, and provision telephony services.
